Welcome to Codsworth's home!
This repository contains the main code threads that I am currently working on, as well as funny moments from the life of a (semi-dormant) nuclear-bomb-powered robot, named Codsworth....

Codsworth's Quote of the day:
"Uh... sir, if I may. I don't think it's entirely safe here."

Feel free to adventure around as well as make reccomendations for improvements!
